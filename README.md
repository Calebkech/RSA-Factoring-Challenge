# Factorization Script

This script reads a file containing natural numbers greater than 1, factorizes each number into a product of two smaller numbers, and prints the factorization.

## Usage

```bash
python factors.py <file>
<file>: A file containing natural numbers to factor, with one number per line.
Requirements
Python 3.x

Example

15
28
7
